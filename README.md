A web based server/editor that can be used to edit Comic Archives (e.g. \*.cbz files) in various ways.

The server currently supports:

- Editing the metadata (ComicBook.xml) of an archive, including individual page metadata
- Generating a cover file for an archive
- Flattening/Renaming the entries of archives in bulk to standardized names.
- Joining images within an archive together (e.g. double page spreads)
- Spltting an Archive into multiple smaller archives (e.g. spltting a Volume into multiple Chapters)
- Editing the metadata of multiple archives in bulk using CSV
